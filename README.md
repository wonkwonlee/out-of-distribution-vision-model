## Summary
This research work provides a fair and in-depth out-of-distribution robustness comparison among 58 state-of-the-art computer vision model such as vision transformers, convolution, combination of convolution and attention, multi layer perceptron, sequence-based model,
complementary search, and network-based model. 

## Abstract
The vision transformer (ViT) has advanced to the cutting edge in the visual recognition task. 
Transformers are more robust than CNN, according to the latest research. 
ViTâ€™s self-attention mechanism, according to the claim, makes it more robust than CNN. 
Even with this, we discover that these conclusions are based on unfair experimental conditions and just comparing a few models, which did not allow
us to depict the entire scenario of robustness performance.
In this study, we investigate the performance of 58 state-ofthe-art computer vision models in a unified training setup based not only on attention and convolution mechanisms but also on neural networks based on a combination of convolution and attention mechanisms, sequence-based model, complementary search, and network-based method. 
Our research demonstrates that robustness depends on the training setup and model types, and performance varies based on out-of-distribution type. 
Our research will aid the community in better understanding and benchmarking the robustness of computer vision models.
